,Pre-Screening Stage
,"The AI pre-screening stage provided an initial filter of proposals, checking alignment with the chosen theme (e.g., Distributed Decision Making). It applies clear criteria—focus, deliverables, and relevance—without assessing budget or feasibility. The outcome is a preliminary, transparent, and auditable list that organizes proposals before deeper human evaluation. The text of the prompt can be verified below."

,"After the pre-screening stage made with ChatGPT 5, the proposals that passed (aligned or borderline alignment) were organized into four separate lists — one for each Fund 14 category of Project Catalyst (Developers, Partners & Products, Ecosystem, Concepts). These pre-screening lists, focused on the theme of Distributed Decision Making (DDM), were saved as PDFs for record-keeping and transparency and can be verified below.
Important note: These are not endorsement lists. The final endorsed list can be found in the next tab of the spreadsheet, titled “Distributed Decision Making – Final Evaluation.” This final list already excludes all proposals removed by the *L2 Moderation Bounty program and represents the definitive set of proposals considered for in-depth evaluation.
