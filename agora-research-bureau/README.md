**Agora Research Bureau**

Agora Research Bureau is the analytical arm of Agora, serving as the core hub for research, analysis, and knowledge production within the initiative. It is structured around two specialized branches: Agora Research Voltaire and Agora Research Catalyst.

We operate as information scouts and critical thinkers, navigating multiple sources, communities, and viewpoints — not to amplify noise, but to synthesize meaningful perspectives, expose structural risks, and strengthen the quality of collective decision-making.

Grounded in game theory, critical thinking, aligned incentive design, and a commitment to real decentralization and accountability, Agora is not here to follow consensus — but to challenge it when necessary with principled dissent. This is how we contribute to Cardano’s future.

Agora Research Bureau publishes open-access reports with clear rationale, critical assessments, and methodological transparency — aiming to empower meaningful community participation and uphold the long-term sustainability of Cardano governance.

These reports complement the on-chain vote metadata submitted by Agora as a registered Voltaire dRep, providing extended context, reasoned justification, and editorial framing to support broader understanding and enable public scrutiny.
